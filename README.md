# Eyes Bandage

Prevents your eyes from bleeding out.

Pomodoro-style app that blocks UI every X minutes (30 by default) and introducing 5 min work break.

Note: This is a reflection of my nostalgy after similar app(s) I had on older Ubuntu versions, which is now either broken or abandoned by the authors.
And hopefully I can add multi-monitor support.
